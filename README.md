This is a script that is designed to be used by the Society for Enviornmental Exploration and its Affilates to produce their quarterly reports. 
For help setting up the script, please see the guides at HQ. Alternatively, you can ask the R&O department to set it up for you.

It also has a basic BibLatex file you can populate yourself if you do not have a reference manage that can do that for you. 

If you are new to LaTeX, you can use the included guide for a brief overview of how to set up your document.
